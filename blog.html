            <p class="text-gray-700 space-y-2">
               <span class="block">In programming, map, forEach, filter, and find are all methods used to manipulate arrays.</span>
                <span class="block"> Map changes each item in an array and creates a new array with the new values.</span>
              
                 <span class="block">forEach goes through each item in an array and does something to them  but doesn't create a new array.</span> 
               <span class="block">filter creates a new array with only the items that match a certain condition.</span>
                <span class="block"> find returns the first item in an array that matches a certain condition. </span>

                what is the difference between local storage, cookies storage and  session storage?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 space-y-2">
               <span class="block">The Key difference between local storage ,cookies storage and session storage is:</span>
                <span class="block"> Local storage: This lets you store data on a user's browser that will stay there even if they close the browser or turn off their computer.</span>
              
                 <span class="block">
                    Cookies storage: This lets you store small amounts of data on a user's browser, but it can be removed by the user or expire after a certain amount of time.</span> 
               <span class="block">Session storage: This is like local storage, but the data only lasts as long as the user's browser is open. Once they close the browser, the data is gone.</span>

                what is event loop and how does it works?</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 space-y-2">
               <span class="block">The event loop is a feature in JavaScript that allows the code to keep running without getting stuck when it needs to wait for something to happen. </span>
                <span class="block"> It means , The event loop in JavaScript works in a  way that allowing multiple tasks to be performed simultaneously without blocking the execution of other code.</span>
              
                 <span class="block">
                    For example, imagine you have a function that needs to wait for some data to be fetched from a server before it can continue running. Normally, this would cause the code to get stuck, and the user would have to wait for the data to be fetched before the function can continue.</span> 
               <span class="block">With the event loop, the code can keep running other tasks while it waits for the data to be fetched. When the data is ready, the event loop will let the code know, so it can continue running from where it left off. </span>
